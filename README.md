### Course Overview:
[Syllabus](https://github.com/eng-jonathan/QC_MATH_342/blob/master/syllabus/syllabus_math342.pdf)
* Philosophy of modeling and learning using data
* Prediction via the ordinary linear model including orthogonal projections, sum of squares identity, R2 and RMSE
* Polynomial and interaction regressions
* Prediction with machine learning including neural nets (the perceptron), support vector machines and the tree methods CART, bagged trees and Random Forests
* Probability estimation using logistic regression, asymmetric cost classifiers and the ROC / DET performance curves
* Underfitting vs. overfitting and the bias-variance decomposition / tradeoff
* Model validation including out of sample techniques such as cross validation and bootstrap validation
* Correlation vs. causation, causal models, lurking variables and interpretations of linear model coefficients
* Extrapolation
* The R language will be taught formally from the ground and up as well as visualization using the ggplot library and manipulation using the dplyr and data.table libraries.

### Incorporated Topics
* Basic Probability Theory: axioms, conditional probability, in/dependence
* Modeling with discrete random variables: Bernoulli, Hypergeometric, Binomial, Poisson, Geometric, Negative Binomial, Uniform Discrete and others
* Expectation and variance
* Modeling with continuous random variables: Exponential, Uniform and Normal
* Frequentist confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for one-sample proportions
* Basic visualization of data: plots, histograms, bar charts
* Linear algebra: Vectors, matrices, rank, transpose
* Programming: basic data types, vectors, arrays, control flow (for, while, if, else), functions
