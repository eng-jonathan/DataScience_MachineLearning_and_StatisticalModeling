* • Used ***Supervised Machine Learning*** to create a more accurate price prediction model than *Zillow.com’s “zestimates”*
• Developed in ***R*** and incorporates data manipulation, linear and quadratic regressions, and random forest to compare
multiple predictive models

### Results

✓ Random Forest Model predicts within $27,000. (The Average Home Price is $315,000)

✗ Model Requires more observations to accurately predict extrapolated data, however performs well within the included zipcodes.
